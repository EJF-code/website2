<p>The K'omoks Valley, also known as the "Land of Plenty", is rich in history dating back to the jurassic period. Fossils of prehistoric plants and animals are found in many riverbeds and eroding shale cliffsides in the area.</p>

<p>This land has also been occupied "Since time imemorial" by the First People belonging to some of the local First Nations. These indigenous groups looked much different in the past than they do today, including changes to where they lived. </p>
