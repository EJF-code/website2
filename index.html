<div class="opening">Artifacts, cultural history, and<br>
  archaeological sites within K'omoks territory.</div>

<div class="welcome">Welcome to our home on the Salish Sea, we are the K'omoks First Nation; decendants of Pentlatch, K'omoks, and Kwak'wala speaking people. We are a diverse nation, in our shared K'omoks, Coast Salish & Kwak'wak'awakw roots.</div>

<h1 class="territory">Territory</h1>

  <p class="green">Traditionally, Island K’omoks territory extended from Salmon River in Sayward to Cape Lazo/Point Holmes, and included Quadra Island. However, by the time of contact with Europeans in 1792, the Laichwiltach (who speak Li'kwala, a dialect of Kwak'wala) had begun an aggressive southward expansion that would displace the Island K’omoks from their original lands. <br>
  <br>
  Today, noting a complex collective history of movement and change, we recognize our territory reaches from Sayward to Denman Island, including Quadra and Hornby Islands, as well as the Comox Valley.
  </p>

<h1 class="pentlatch">Pentlatch</h1>

  <p class="orange">
    The Valley was first home to the Pentlatch people; a distinct language family with close cultural ties to the Qualicum Nation. Pentlatch territory extended from Cape Lazo to Fanny Bay. The land of plenty provided for populations of up to 2000 Pentlatch in the Valley for generations, as noted by the extensive fish trap technologies still evident within the estuary.<br>
    <br>
    K’omoks people first settled on Denman Island and the nearby shores, living alongside the Pentlatch. Both had been devastated by battles and European brought diseases, which wiped out up to 90% of local poplations. K’omoks and Pentlatch sought mutual protection and alliance in defence against further invasion. Our ancestors came together at the winter village of the Pentlatch, where K’omoks I.R. 1 is today.<br>
    <br>
    The late <strong>Chief Joe NimNim</strong> (est.1800) was the last fluent speaker of the Pentlatch language. He lived by the river near where the Puntledge Campground is today, which is also a Pentlatch village site. This site later became a reserve, which was amalgamated as K'omoks I.R. 2.<br>
    <br>
    Descendants of Pentlatch, various Island K’omoks local groups, as well as Lekwiltok compose the modern K'omoks Nation. We also share areas of our territory with our Northern Salish relatives.

 <h1 class="nsalish">Northern Salish</h1>

    <p class="blue"> K'omoks, along with <strong>Homalco</strong>, <strong>Klahoose</strong>, and <strong>TlaAmin Nations</strong> are sister nations of the northern most reach of Coast Salish Territory; and are part of the unique language family known as <strong>Ayajuthem</strong>, or "<strong>Comox Language</strong>". In the past, two dialects of Ayajuthem were spoken: "<strong>Island Comox</strong>" and "<strong>Mainland Comox</strong>".<br>
    <br>
    Due to colonization and intergenerational impacts of residential schools, the Island Comox dialect of Ayajuthem is no longer spoken. <br>
    <br>
    The late <strong>Mary Clifton</strong> (1990) was the last speaker of the Island Comox dialect.
    <!-- has conveyed the origin story of a man named Shalhk’em and woman named Tisitl’a that “dropped down from the sky” at kwaniwsam (Quinsam) in present-day Campbell River. -->

    Revitalizaton of the mainland dialect is ongoing, as there are only a handfull of fluent speakers, making it a highly endangered language. Though the K'omoks First Nation has no fluent speakers, many members are activley learning Ayajuthem today.</p>
<!-- K'omoks Nation has approx 330 members -->
