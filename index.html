<p>This land has been occupied since time imemorial by its first people, distinguished by family or language groups, village sites, and territories. These groups looked much different in the past than they do today, including immense changes in population and to where they live. Oral histories and early documentation show the lands in and around the K'omoks Valley were first inhabited by Pentlatch people. Pentlatch had a village site at the Puntledge River.</p>

<!-- K'omoks Nation has approx 330 members -->
  <h2> K'omoks Reserves</h2>
    <h5>Did you know? The Indian Act was first implimented by the Government of Canada in 1867, assigning legislative dominion over "Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians." This act paved the way for removal of indigenous people from the land, containing them to much smaller fragments of their traditional territory.</h5>
