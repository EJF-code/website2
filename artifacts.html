   <h1 class="fish">Fish Weirs</h1>

        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsEnk9ky0f0&feature=emb_title" target="_blank">Wooden fish weirs</a> in wet sites on our shores are the best preserved examples in North America, and may be the largest prehistoric archaeological feature on the Northwest Coast. These fish traps were utilized for hudreds of years, trapping herring and salmon.

        <h2> Wooden Stakes</h2>

        <img src="images/point.JPG" alt="a wooden stake examined during an archeological restoration on KFN R1"/>

        <p>Stakes made of predominantly young spruce and hemlock stretch the length of the estuary on both shorelines, to the extent of Goose Spit and Royston. Radiocarbon dates from a chevron-shaped fish trap has been dated to the late 16th century. The 16th century lasted from 1500 to 1600.</p>

        <h2> Panels </h2>

        <img src="images/1longpanel.JPG" alt="a 6m long fish weir panel uncovered near IR1"/>

        <p>Panels were inserted between the wooden stakes in order to entrap fish within. Panels were comprised components in weaving: The warp, the wheft, as well as twining. Using roots and branches, these long panels were lashed together.

        <p> Two radiocarbon dates derived from the weft elements of the panel indicate it was constructed in the late 14th century. The 14th century was a century lasting from 1300 to 1400.</p>

        <h1 class="pp"> Pentlatch Pebbles </h1>

        <p>The K'omoks First Nation has partnered with Simon Fraser University Archaeology to enage in two digs at the Puntledge River site, a traditional village of Pentlatch ancestors. Amidst the blackened charcoal earth and mounds of shell fragments, hundreds of carved stone artifacts have been found. These stones, coined "Pentlatch Pebbles", are so unique that the likes of which have only been found in two other places in the world. Common arifacts are bone point tools, Lithic (stone) tools, and most predominantly Fire Cracked Rock and flakes from the creation of tools.</p>

        <div class="hand">
        <img src="images/hand.jpg" alt="a pentlatch pebble held in someones hand"/></div>

        <div class="pebbledesc"/>
          <ul>
            <li>Round, flat, smooth stones</li>
            <li>Incised (carved into) </li>
            <li>Various lined designs </li>
          </ul></div>

      <p> These stones were found amongst the stratafied layers of soil and sediments. Archaeologists were able to date the stones by analyzing the surrounding charcoal, known as radiocarbon dating. Based on this dating technology, the shell midden began to form in this area around the year AD 375 while the top of the midden in this location dates to approximately AD 612.<br>
      <br>
      Evidence has shown that these samples were taken from deposits of the floor of a house. These dates indicate that the house was likely in use around AD 700 or slightly later</p>
